This [domain](http://pitakill.net) is almost in its thirteen anniversary, in the first steps was a blog about my GNU/Linux stuff, and a catalog of some weird recording of the cuban songwriter Silvio Rodríguez. The engine behind was JAWS, made by some folks in México.<!--more-->

Why revive it? Because:

- I can
- A space to write some stuff about my new skills in some programming languages
- A place where I can share my though about my readings
- And all the things that can go in a blog :-P

So, in my next post i'm going to explain some basic infrastructure of the site.

Later folks.
