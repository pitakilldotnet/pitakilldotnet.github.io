      <description>This site was hosted in a VPS with 128 MB of RAM, and 10GB of disk space. So far, so good. These specs are sufficient enough for run a hugo server, a nginx reverse proxy. And with Let&amp;rsquo;s Encrypt all is served with SSL.
Everything is smooth with this configuration, but in a near future (next month) the plan with the VPS is over, and there is not possible to extend the contract because the provider was acquired by a third and the product was outdated.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;http://pitakill.net&#34;&gt;domain&lt;/a&gt; is almost in its thirteen anniversary, in the first steps was a blog about my GNU/Linux stuff, and a catalog of some weird recording of the cuban songwriter Silvio Rodríguez. The engine behind was JAWS, made by some folks in México.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
